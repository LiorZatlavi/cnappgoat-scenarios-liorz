  description: | 
    In this scenario, an Azure Storage Account with Blob Container, restricted to owner access only, is provisioned to store 
    protected health information (PHI) data. The data is maintained in two distinct blobs. The primary purpose of this scenario 
    is to emulate an Azure Blob Container containing basic sensitive information, with the goal of testing a data security 
    product's ability to detect such data. This assessment is crucial in evaluating the security product's effectiveness in 
    identifying and safeguarding sensitive information housed within cloud-based storage services.
