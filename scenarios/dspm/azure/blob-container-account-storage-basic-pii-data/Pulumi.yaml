  description: | 
    In this scenario, an Azure Storage Account with Blob Container, restricted to owner access only, is provisioned 
    to store personally identifiable information (PII) data. The data is maintained in two blobs, one formatted in CSV 
    and the other in JSON. The primary purpose of this scenario is to emulate an Azure Blob Container containing basic sensitive 
    information, to test a data security product's ability to detect such data. This assessment is vital in evaluating the 
    security product's effectiveness in identifying and safeguarding sensitive information housed within cloud-based storage 
    services.
