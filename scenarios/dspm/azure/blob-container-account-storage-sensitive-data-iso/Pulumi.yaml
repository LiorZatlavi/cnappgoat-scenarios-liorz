  description: |
    In this scenario, an Azure Blob Container within a Storage Account is set up, with access limited to the owner. 
    It is used to store ISO files with sensitive data. The main objective is to evaluate a data security product's capacity
    to identify this type of data. This evaluation is crucial for determining the product's ability to detect and protect
    sensitive information in cloud storage services.
