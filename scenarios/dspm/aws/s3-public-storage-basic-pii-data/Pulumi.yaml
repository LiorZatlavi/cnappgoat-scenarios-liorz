description: The scenario provision public access level  S3 bucket containing PII data.
cnappgoat-params:
  description: In this scenario, a publicly accessible Amazon Simple Storage Service (S3) bucket
   is provisioned to contain personally identifiable information (PII) data. 
   The data is stored in two separate files, one in CSV format and the other in JSON format. 
   The primary objective of this scenario is to simulate an AWS S3 bucket containing basic 
   sensitive information, with the aim of testing whether a data security product is capable 
   of detecting this type of data. This exercise is crucial in evaluating the effectiveness of 
   the security product in identifying and protecting sensitive information stored in 
   cloud-based storage services.
