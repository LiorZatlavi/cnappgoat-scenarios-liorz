cnappgoat-params:
  description:  In this scenario, an Amazon S3 bucket is set up with access limited to the organization 
    and is used to store sensitive iso files. The main objective is to evaluate a data security product's 
    capacity to identify this type of data. This evaluation is crucial for determining the product's ability 
    to detect and protect sensitive information in cloud storage services.
