  description: This scenario creates an AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) user
    without Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) and a login profile, using Pulumi's
    AWS and SDK libraries. The issue with this is it does not follow security best
    practices as IAM users with console access should have MFA enabled for security
    reasons. To remedy this situation, the program should be modified to include steps
    for enabling MFA during or after the user creation process.
