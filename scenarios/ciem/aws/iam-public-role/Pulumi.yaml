description: The scenario deploys a public IAM role,
  which poses a security risk by granting access to all principals. Remedy this by
  restricting the Principal field in AssumeRolePolicy to specific entities instead
  of all.

  description: The given scenario deploys a public Identity and Access Management
    (IAM) role using Pulumi's AWS SDK. The issue here is the potential security vulnerability,
    as the role configuration allows any AWS principal to assume the role, increasing
    the risks of unauthorized access and potentially dangerous actions. To remediate
    this, it's advised to implement strict access measures by defining specific principals
    that can assume this role and implementing necessary IAM policies, thus shoring
    up the security weakness in the current setup.
