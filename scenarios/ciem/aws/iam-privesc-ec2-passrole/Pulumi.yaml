description: The scenario creates an IAM role with EC2 passrole permissions which
  could lead to unauthorized access. To remediate, restrict the permissions to
  the necessary resources only.

  description: The scenario deployed by the code creates an IAM role with EC2 and
    passrole permissions. The issue is that it lacks restrictions, specifically in
    the role policy where it allows 'ec2:RunInstances' and 'iam:PassRole' on all resources.
    This could potentially grant malicious users too much access. A remediation would
    be to enforce a stringent policy, narrowing down the resources the role has access
    to, thereby reducing the permissions to necessary ones only.
