description: This scenario deploys a CodeBuild machine with a highly privileged administrator
  role, which risks widespread access and potential misuse. To remedy this, assign
  the least privileged role necessary for CodeBuild function and limit its access.

  description: This scenario sets up a CodeBuild machine with a highly privileged
    administrative service role, which implies a potential security risk due to overly
    broad permissions. The problem arises in the attachment of the 'AdministratorAccess'
    policy to the 'codeBuildRole', granting it widespread privileges. To remediate
    this, ensure that the IAM role for CodeBuild is assigned only the required permissions.
    Replace the 'AdministratorAccess' role with a more restricted policy that provides
    the necessary access for specific operations.
