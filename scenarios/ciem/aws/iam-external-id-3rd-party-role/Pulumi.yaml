description: The scenario creates an IAM role without an external ID parameter. 
  This exposes your account to confused deputy attacks.

  IAM role trust policy during the creation process.

  description: The scenario involves the creation of an IAM role for a 3rd party without
    an external ID parameter. This flaw escalates the risk of impersonation attacks,
    especially 'confused deputy' scenarios, where rogue actors might access your account
    using the same vendor's services. To mitigate this issue, it's essential to include
    an 'External ID' in the trust policy of the IAM role, thereby adding an extra
    layer of security against potential impersonators.
