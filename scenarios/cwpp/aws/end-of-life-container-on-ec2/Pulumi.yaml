  description: The script deploys an EC2 instance running an EOL Ubuntu 21.10 within
    a Docker container. This poses a security issue as the EOL operating system version
    doesn't receive updates or patches, leaving it vulnerable. Fix this by updating
    the Docker container to use the most recent and supported Ubuntu version.
