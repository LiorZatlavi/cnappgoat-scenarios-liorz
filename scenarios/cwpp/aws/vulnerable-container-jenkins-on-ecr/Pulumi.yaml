  description: The scenario's operation involves deploying an Elastic Container Registry
    (ECR) with a susceptible Jenkins container. Its problem originates
    from the potential security risks posed by the vulnerable Jenkins container, exposing
    the system to cyber threats. The remediation requires using an updated, fully
    patched Jenkins container, thereby minimizing the threat to the containerized
    apps it oversees.
