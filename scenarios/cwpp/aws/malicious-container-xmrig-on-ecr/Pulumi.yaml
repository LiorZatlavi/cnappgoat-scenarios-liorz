  description: The scenario creates a container with an XMRig miner on the Elastic
    Container Registry (ECR), potentially misusing CPU resources for unauthorized
    cryptocurrency mining. This is done by creating a malicious image and uploading
    it to the ECR repository. Issues may occur when this image is deployed without
    the owner's consent. To fix this, monitor traffic for unusual patterns, strengthen
    access policies, and regularly scan for vulnerabilities. Avoid using public images
    to mitigate risk.
