  description: This scenario enables creation of a VM with an out-of-date OS, specifically Ubuntu 21.10, to test if the CNAPP solution generates
    alerts for deprecated OS versions. The issue with this scenario is the intentional
    use of an out-of-date OS which exposes the system to vulnerabilities and lacks
    updates or support. To remediate this, refrain from using deprecated operating
    system versions and ensure the OS image used for any VM creation is up-to-date
    and receives regular security patches.
