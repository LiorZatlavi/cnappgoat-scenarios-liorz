  description: The scenario involves the creation of a new S3 bucket that tolerates
    unencrypted http access. A problem arises with this scenario as it poses potential
    security threats due to the lack of encryption for the file being uploaded to
    the bucket. Possible data breaches can be prevented by ensuring the use of encrypted
    HTTPS access instead of unencrypted HTTP, thereby enhancing the security and integrity
    of the data transferred.
