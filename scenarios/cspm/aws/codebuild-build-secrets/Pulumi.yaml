description: The scenario deploys a codebuild project which includes
  sensitive data in the buildspec. To resolve this, secrets should be handled via 
  AWS Secrets Manager or as environment variables, rather than in the buildspec.

  description: The scenario given establishes a codebuild machine with secrets stored
    unencrypted in the buildspec file, which is a security vulnerability. The code
    deploys an AWS CodeBuild project and an IAM role with access to AWS services like
    S3 and Logs. While it seems functional, storing secrets in the clear within a
    buildspec is a bad practice as it exposes sensitive data. To remedy this, AWS
    Secrets Manager or AWS Systems Manager Parameter Store should be used to store
    sensitive data securely for access during builds. The secrets can then be accessed
    securely using the appropriate AWS SDK commands.
