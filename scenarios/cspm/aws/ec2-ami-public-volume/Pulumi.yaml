runtime: go
description: This scenario generates an EBS volume and a related snapshot, which is registered
  as a public AMI. The issue lies in AMI's public status, resulting in potential unauthorized
  access. To rectify, modify the script to create a private AMI.
cnappgoat-params:
  description: The program creates a new Elastic Block Store (EBS) volume, takes its
    snapshot and registers that snapshot as a public Amazon Machine Image (AMI).
    However, the problem in doing so is that public AMIs might pose
    serious security risks as they can be accessed by anyone. To remediate the problem,
    restrict AMI's access to specific people or groups, or avoid making it public.
    Modify the 'ec2.AmiLaunchPermissionArgs' to limit the AMI availability to specific
    groups or individuals.
