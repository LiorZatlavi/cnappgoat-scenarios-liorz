  description: This scenario involves deploying an S3 public bucket with confidential
    data. The code creates a bucket and sets it to public, making the contained secrets easily accessible, which is a significant security
    risk. To remediate the issue, consider activating the BlockPublicAcls, BlockPublicPolicy,
    IgnorePublicAcls, and RestrictPublicBuckets parameters, ensuring that bucket policies
    restrict unnecessary access, and the stored secrets are protected from unwarranted
    public exposure.
