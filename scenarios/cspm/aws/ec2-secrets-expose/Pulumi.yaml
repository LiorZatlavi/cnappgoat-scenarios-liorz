  description: The scenario creates a new EC2 instance suing Pulumi, with sensitive
    information ("mysecretpassword1231") in the user data. The issue is that placing
    secrets in the user data presents a major security risk, as this data is not encrypted
    and can be easily accessed. To solve the problem, secrets should be stored securely
    using AWS Secrets Manager or AWS Parameter Store, allowing the EC2 instance to
    retrieve them securely when needed.
