  through leakage of sensitive data, secrets and more.
cnappgoat-params:
  description: In this scenario, an image is deployed in artifact registry with an attached IAM configuration setting it to be publicly
    readable, making it accessible to any individual or entity.
    Such open accessibility raises significant security concerns. The image, if not properly configured or containing embedded sensitive
    data, could potentially lead to the exposure of confidential information, system secrets, or other critical data. It's imperative to
    adopt protective measures like private repositories, scan for vulnerabilities, and strict access controls to ensure the safeguarding
    of the images and the embedded data.
