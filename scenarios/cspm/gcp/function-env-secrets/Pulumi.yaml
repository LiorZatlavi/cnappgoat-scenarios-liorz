  description: In this scenario, a Cloud Function is deployed with secrets in its environment variables, posing a significant security 
    risk. Directly embedding secrets can lead to unintentional leaks and potential unauthorized access to critical resources. 
    To enhance security, it's recommended to use a secret management service. 
    By doing so, secrets are stored encrypted in a centralized location, isolated from the application code. 
    This approach not only safeguards the secrets but also allows for better control, audit logging, and ease of rotation. 
    Always prioritize secure handling of sensitive information.
