runtime: go
description: This scenario deploys a compute instance in GCE and stores secrets in its metadata start-up script. These secrets can be
  potentially leaked and unauthorized access to arbitrary services can occur.
cnappgoat-params:
  description: In this situation, a compute instance is deployed on GCE, with secrets embedded directly within its metadata start-up 
    script. Such an approach poses notable vulnerabilities. If these secrets are exposed, they become a gateway for malicious entities to
    gain unauthorized entry into various services. It's crucial to adopt encrypted storage solutions, implement stringent access controls,
    and regularly monitor activity logs.
    Diligent management of secrets can significantly mitigate the associated risks and safeguard systems.
